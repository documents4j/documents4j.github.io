<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 40px;">
    documents4j is a Java library for converting documents into another document format. This is achieved by
    delegating the conversion to any native application which understands the conversion of the given file into the
    desired target format. documents4j comes with adaptations for MS Word and MS Excel for Windows what allows for
    example for the conversion of a <i>docx</i> file into a <i>pdf</i> file without the usual distortions in the
    resulting document which are often observed for conversions that were conducted using non-Microsoft products.
</p>

<p>
    documents4j offers a simple API and two implementations of this API:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal padded">
    <dt>Local</dt>
    <dd>
        The local API implementation delegates a document conversion to an application on the same machine
        which is capable of applying the requested conversion. For this to work, the executing machine requires an
        installation of the backing conversion software such as for example MS Word or MS Excel. documents4j offers a
        simple mechanism for registering custom converters but ships with implementations of such converters for MS
        Word and MS Excel for Windows.
    </dd>
    <dt>Remote</dt>
    <dd>
        The remote API implementation delegates a document conversion to a server which is queried by a simple
        REST-API. For this to happen, it sends the file to the server and includes information about the requested
        document conversion formats. It then receives the converted document as a response to its request.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    To users of the documents4j API, it is fully transparent which implementation is used. This way, a local conversion
    implementation can for example be applied in a test environment while applying the remote implementation in
    production. Also, this allows for easy mocking of the converter back-end.
</p>


<h3>The API</h3>

<p>
    documents4j uses a fluent API for performing a document conversion. As mentioned, the API does not expose any
    details of the backing converter implementation. Instead, a converter is represented by an instance of
    <code>IConverter</code>. Using this converter, an example conversion of a MS Word file into a PDF is executed as
    follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
File wordFile = new File( ... ), target = new File( ... );
IConverter converter = ... ;
Future&lt;Boolean&gt; conversion = converter
                                .convert(wordFile).as(DocumentType.MS_WORD)
                                .to(target).as(DocumentType.PDF)
                                .prioritizeWith(1000) // optional
                                .schedule();
</pre>

<p>
    All methods of the <code>IConverter</code> interface and its builder types offer overloaded methods. Instead of
    providing <code>File</code> instances, it is also possible to provide an <code>InputStream</code> as a source
    document and an <code>OutputStream</code> for writing the result. These streams are never closed by documents4j. As
    another option, the source document can be obtained by querying an <code>IInputStreamSource</code> or an
    <code>IFileSource</code> which offer generic callback methods which are then used by documents4j. Similarly, the
    <code>IInputStreamConsumer</code> and <code>IFileConsumer</code> interfaces allow for implementing a generic way of
    processing the result of a conversion. However, note that these callbacks are normally triggered from
    another thread. These threads are used by documents4j internally such that you should not perform heavy tasks from
    these callbacks. documents4j is fully thread-safe as long as it is not stated differently.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, a conversion can be prioritized via <code>prioritizeWith</code> where a higher priority signals to the
    converter that a conversion should be conducted before a conversion with lower priority if both conversions are
    getting queued. documents4j is capable of performing document conversions concurrently and puts conversion into an
    internal job queue which is organized by these priorities. There is however not guarantee that a conversion with
    higher priority is performed before a conversion with lower priority.
</p>

<p>
    A conversion can be scheduled to be executed in the background by calling <code>schedule</code> after
    specifying a conversion. Alternatively, by calling <code>execute</code>, the current thread will block until the
    conversion is finished. The resulting <code>boolean</code> indicates if a conversion was successful. Exceptional
    conversion results are however communicated by exceptions which are described below.
</p>

<p>
    For finding out which conversions are supported by an <code>IConverter</code>, you can query the
    <code>getSupportedConversions</code> method which returns a map of source formats to their supported target formats.
    Furthermore, you can call the <code>isOperational</code> in order to check the functionality of a converter. A
    converter might not be operational because its prerequisites are not met. Those prerequisites are described below
    for each implementation of an <code>IConverter</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Note that an <code>IConverter</code> implementation might describe a rather expensive structure as it is normally
    backed by external resources such as native processes or a network connection. For repeated conversions, you should
    reuse the same instance of an <code>IConverter</code>. Furthermore, note that an <code>IConverter</code> has an
    explicit life-cycle and must be shut down by invoking <code>shutDown</code>. documents4j registers a shut-down hook
    for shutting down converter instances, but you should never rely on this mechanism. Once an <code>IConverter</code>
    was shut down, it cannot be restarted. After a converter was shut down, its <code>isOperational</code> always
    returns <code>false</code>.
</p>

<h3>Local converter</h3>

<p>
    The <code>LocalConverter</code> implementation of <code>IConverter</code> performs conversions by converting files
    within the same (non-virtual) machine. A <code>LocalConverter</code> is created by using a simple builder:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
IConverter converter = LocalConverter.builder()
                           .baseFolder(new File("C:\Users\documents4j\temp"));
                           .workerPool(20, 25, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                           .processTimeout(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                           .build();
</pre>

<p>
    The above converter was configured to write temporary files into the given folder. If this property is set,
    documents4j creates a random folder. By setting a worker pool, you determine the maximum number of concurrent
    conversions that are attempted by documents4j. A meaningful value is ultimately determined by the capabilities of
    the backing converters. It is however also determined by the executing machine's CPU and memory. An optimal value is
    best found by trial-and-error.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, a timeout for external processes of 5 seconds is set. In order to convert a file into another document
    format, the conversion is delegated to an implementation of <code>IExternalConverter</code>. Such external
    converters normally start a process on the OS for invoking a conversion by some installed software. documents4j
    ships with two such external converters, once implementation for MS Word on Windows and one for MS Excel on Windows.
    If these converters are found on the class path, the <code>LocalConverter</code> discovers and loads them
    automatically unless they are explicitly deregistered by the builder's <code>disable</code> method. Custom
    converters need to be registered explicitly by the builder's <code>enable</code> method.
</p>

<p>
    Note that the builder itself is mutable and not thread-safe. The resulting <code>LocalConverter</code> on the other
    side is fully thread-safe.
</p>

<h4>Microsoft Word converter</h4>

<p>
    The MS Word converter is represented by a <code>MicrosoftWordBridge</code> instance. This bridge starts MS Word when
    the connected <code>LocalConverter</code> is started an quits Word once the local converter is shut down. Note that
    this implies that only a single active <code>LocalConverter</code> instance must exist not only for a JVM but for
    the entire physical machine. Otherwise, MS Word might be shut down by one bridge while it is still required by
    another instance. This cannot be controlled by documents4j but must be assured by its user. Also, make sure not to
    use MS Word outside of a Java application while a <code>MicrosoftWordBridge</code> is active, for example by opening
    it from your desktop.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, the <code>LocalConverter</code> can only be run if:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The JVM is run on a MS Windows platform that ships with the Microsoft Scripting Host for VBS (this is true for
        all contemporary versions of MS Windows.
    </li>
    <li>
        MS Word is installed in version 2007 or higher. PDF conversion is only supported when the PDF plugin is
        installed. The plugin is included into MS Word from Word 2010 and higher.
    </li>
    <li>
        MS Word is not already running when the <code>LocalConverter</code> starts. This is in particularly true for MS
        Word instances that are run by another instance of <code>LocalConverter</code>. (As mentioned, be aware that
        this is also true for instances running on a different JVM or that are loaded by a different class loader.)
    </li>
    <li>
        MS Word is properly activated and configured for the user running the JVM. MS Word does therefore not require
        any configuration on program startup or any other wizard.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the JVM application which uses the <code>LocalConverter</code> is run as a service, note the information on
        using MS Word from the MS Windows service profile below.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note that MS Windows's process model requires GUI processes (such as MS Word) to be started as a child of a specific
    MS Windows process. Thus, the MS Word process is never a child process of the JVM process. Thus, the MS Word process
    will survive in case that the JVM process is killed without triggering its shut-down hooks. Make sure to always end
    your JVM process normally when using documents4j. Otherwise, orphan processes might live without the JVM process.
    documents4j will however attempt to reuse these processes after a restart.
</p>

<h4>Microsoft Excel converter</h4>

<p>
    The MS Excel converter is represented by a <code>MicrosoftExcelBridge</code> instance. All information that was
    given on the <code>MicrosoftWordBridge</code> apply to the MS Excel bridge. However, note that MS Excel is not
    equally robust as MS Word when it comes to concurrent access. For this reason, the <code>MicrosoftExcelBridge</code>
    only allows for the concurrent conversion of a single file. This property is enforced by documents4j by using an
    internal lock.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Important</b>: Note that you have to manually add a dependency to either the <code>MicrosoftWordBridge</code> or
    the <code>MicrosoftExcelBridge</code> when using the <code>LocalConverter</code>. The MS Word bridge is contained by
    the <i>com.documents4j/documents4j-transformer-msoffice-word</i> Maven module and the MS Excel bridge by the
    <i>com.documents4j/documents4j-transformer-msoffice-excel</i> module.
</p>

<h4>Give it a try</h4>

<p>
    documents4j was written after evaluating several solutions for converting <i>docx</i> files into <i>pdf</i> which
    unfortunately all produced files with layout distortions of different degrees. For these experiences, documents4j
    comes with an evaluation application which is run in the browser. For starting this application, simply run the
    following commands on a Windows machine with MS Word and MS Excel installed:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
git clone https://github.com/documents4j/documents4j.git
cd documents4j
cd documents4j-local-demo
mvn jetty:run
</pre>

<p>
    You can now open <i>http://localhost:8080</i> on you machine's browser and convert files from the browser window. Do
    not kill the application process but shut it down gracefully such that documents4j can shut down its MS Word and MS
    Excel processes. In order for this application to function, MS Word and MS Excel must not be started on application
    startup.
</p>

<h4>Custom converters</h4>

<p>
    Any converter engine is represented by an implementation of <code>IExternalConverter</code>. Any implementation is
    required to define a public constructor which accepts arguments of type <code>File</code>, <code>long</code> and
    <code>TimeUnit</code> as its parameters. The first argument represents an existing folder for writing temporary
    files, the second and third parameters describe the user-defined time out for conversions. Additionally, any class
    must be annotated with <code>@ViableConversion</code> where the annotation's <code>from</code> parameter describes
    accepted input formats and the <code>to</code> parameter accepted output formats. All these formats must be encoded
    as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">parameterless MIME types</a>. If a converter allows
    for distinct conversions of specific formats to another then the <code>@ViableConversions</code> annotation allows
    to define several <code>@ViableConversion</code> annotations.
</p>

<h3>Remote converter</h3>

<p>
    A <code>RemoteConverter</code> is created fairly similar to a <code>LocalConverter</code> by using another builder:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
IConverter converter = RemoteConverter.builder()
                           .baseFolder(new File("C:\Users\documents4j\temp"));
                           .workerPool(20, 25, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                           .requestTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                           .baseUri("http://localhost:9998");
                           .build();
</pre>

<p>
    Similarly to the <code>LocalConverter</code>, the <code>RemoteConverter</code> requires a folder for writing
    temporary files which is created implicitly if no such folder is specified. This time however, the worker pool
    implicitly determines the number of concurrent REST requests for converting a file where the request timeout
    specifies the maximal time such a conversion is allowed to take. As the base URI, the remote converter specifies the
    address of a <i>conversion server</i> which offers a REST API for performing document conversions. Note that all the
    <code>IConverter</code>'s <code>getSupportedConversions</code> and <code>isOperational</code> methods delegate to
    this REST API as well and are not cached.
</p>

<h3>Conversion server</h3>

<p>
    documents4j offers a standalone conversion server which implements the required REST API by using a
    <code>LocalConverter</code> under the covers. This conversion server is contained in the
    <i>com.documents4j/documents4j-server-standalone</i> module. The Maven build creates a shaded artifact for this
    module which contains all dependencies. This way, the conversion server can be started from the command line, simply
    by:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
java -jar documents4j-server-standalone-shaded.jar http://localhost:9998
</pre>

<p>
    The above command starts the conversion server to listen for a HTTP connection on port 9998 which is now accessible
    to the <code>RemoteConverter</code>. The standalone server comes with a rich set of option which are passed via
    command line. For a comprehensive description, you can print a summary of these options by supplying the `-?` option
    on the command line.
</p>

<p>
    A conversion server can also be started programmatically using a <code>ConversionServerBuilder</code>.
</p>

<h4>Conversion client</h4>

<p>
    Similarly to the conversion server, documents4j ships with a small console client which is mainly intended for
    debugging purposes. Using the client it is possible to connect to a conversion server in order to validate that a
    connection is possible and not prevented by for example active fire walls. The client is contained in the
    <i>com.documents4j/documents4j-client-standalone</i> module. You can connect to a server by:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
java -jar documents4j-client-standalone-shaded.jar http://localhost:9998
</pre>

<p>
    Again, the <code>-?</code> option can be supplied for obtaining a list of options.
</p>

<h3>Exception hierarchy</h3>

<p>
    The exception hierarchy was intentionally kept simple in order to hide the details of an <code>IConverter</code>
    implementation from the end user. All exceptions thrown by the converters <a
        href="http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html">are unchecked</a>. This is of course not true for futures which
    fulfill the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html"><code>Future</code>
    interface contract</a> and wrap any exception in an <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutionException.html">java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException</a>
    whenever <code>Future#get()</code> or <code>Future#get(long, TimeUnit)</code> are invoked.
</p>

<p>
    The native exceptions thrown by an <code>IConverter</code> are either instances of <code>ConverterException</code>
    or one of its subclasses. Instances of <code>ConverterException</code> are only thrown when no specific cause for an
    error could be identified. More specific exceptions are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code>ConversionFormatException</code>:
        The converter was requested to translate a file into a <code>DocumentType</code> that is does not support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>ConversionInputException</code>:
        The source file that was provided for a conversion could not be read in the given source file format. This means
        that the input data either represents another file format or the input data is corrupt and cannot be read by the
        responsible converter.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>FileSystemInteractionException</code>
        The source file does not exist or is locked by the JVM or another application. (<i>Note</i>: You must <b>not</b>
        lock files in the JVM when using a <code>LocalConverter</code> since they might need to be processed by another
        software which is then prevented to do so.) This exception is also thrown when the target file is locked.
        Unlocked, existing files are simply overwritten when a conversion is triggered. Finally, the exception is also
        thrown when using a file stream causes an <code>IOException</code> where the IO exception is wrapped before it
        is rethrown.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>ConverterAccessException</code>:
        This exception is thrown when a <code>IConverter</code> instance is in invalid state. This occurs when an <code>IConverter</code>
        was either shut down or the conditions for using a converter are not met, either because a remote converter
        cannot longer connect to its conversion server or because a backing conversion software is inaccessible. This
        exception can also occur when creating a <code>LocalConverter</code> or a <code>RemoteConverter</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Note</b>: Be aware that <code>IConverter</code> implementations do not follow a prevalence of exceptions. When a
    user is trying to convert a non-existent file with a converter in a bad state, it cannot be guaranteed that this
    will always throw a <code>FileSystemInteractionException</code> instead of a <code>ConverterAccessException</code>.
    The prevalence will differ for different implementations of the <code>IConverter</code> API.
</p>

<h4>Logging</h4>

<p>
    All logging is delegated to the <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J</a> facade and can therefore be processed
    independently of this application. The verbosity of this application's logging behavior is determined by the overall
    logging level where <i>info</i> or <i>warn</i> are recommended as minimum logging levels in production. The
    different logging levels will determine the following events to be logged:
</p>

<dl  class="dl-horizontal padded">
    <dt>trace</dt>
    <dd>
        On this level, all concurrent code will log the acquisition and release of monitors.
    </dd>
    <dt>info</dt>
    <dd>
        On this level, non-exceptional state interactions with external resources will be logged. A logging message will
        for example expose when MS Word is started or stopped or when a conversion server is bound to a port.
    </dd>
    <dt>debug</dt>
    <dd>
        This logging level is not used by this application.
    </dd>
    <dt>warn</dt>
    <dd>
        On this level, non-fatal errors are logged such as the timeout of a HTTP conversion due to high traffic.
        Normally, such log events are accompanied by an exception being thrown.
    </dd>
    <dt>error</dt>
    <dd>
        On this level, all user errors are logged. For example, the attempt of converting a non-existent file
        would cause a logging event on this level. Normally, such events are accompanied by an exception being thrown.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Efficiency considerations</h3>

<h4>Input and target description</h4>

<p>
    The API intents to hide the implementation details of a specific <code>IConverter</code> implementation from the end
    user. However, a <code>RemoteConverter</code> needs to send data as a stream which requires reading it to memory
    first. (As of today, documents4j does not make use of Java NIO.) This is why a <code>RemoteConverter</code> will
    always perform better when handed instances of <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code> as source and
    target compared to files. The <code>LocalConverter</code> on the other hand, communicates with a backing conversion
    software such as MS Word by using the file system. Therefore, instances of <code>File</code> as source and target
    input will perform better when using a <code>LocalConverter</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In the end, a user should however always try to hand the available data to the <code>IConverter</code>
    implementation. The implementation will then figure out by itself what data it requires and convert the data to the
    desired format. In doing so, the converter will also clean up after itself (e.g. closing streams, deleting temporary
    files). There is no performance advantage when input formats are converted manually.
</p>

<h4>Configuring an executing JVM</h4>

<p>
    MS Office components are (of course) not run within the Java virtual machine's process. Therefore, an allocation of
    a significant amount of the operating system's memory to the JVM can cause an opposite effect to performance than
    intended. Since the JVM already reserved most of the operating system's memory, the MS Word processes that were
    started by the JVM will run short for memory. At the same time, the JVM that created these processes remains idle
    waiting for a result. It is difficult to tell what amount of memory should optimally be reserved for the JVM since
    this is highly dependant of the number of concurrent conversion. However, if one observes conversion to be
    critically unperformant, the allocation of a significant amount of memory to the JVM should be considered as a
    cause.
</p>

<h4>Running documents4j application as Windows service</h4>

<p>
    documents4j might malfunction when run as a Windows service together with MS Office conversion. Note that MS Office
    does <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257757">not officially support</a> execution in a service context.
    When run as a service, MS Office is always started with MS Window's local service account which does not configure a
    desktop. However, MS Office expects a desktop to exist in order to run properly. Without such a desktop
    configuration, MS Office will start up correctly but fail to read any input file. In order to allow MS Office to run
    in a service context, there are two possible approaches of which the first approach is more recommended:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        On a 32-bit system, create the folder <i>C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\Desktop</i>. On a 64-bit
        system, create the folder <i>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\Desktop</i>. <a
            href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/b81a3c4e-62db-488b-af06-44421818ef91/excel-2007-automation-on-top-of-a-windows-server-2008-x64?forum=innovateonoffice">Further
        information can be found on MSDN</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can manipulate MS Window's registry such that MS Office applications are run with another account than the
        local service account. <a
            href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/334c9f30-4e27-4904-9e71-abfc65975e23/problem-running-windows-service-with-excel-object-on-windows-server-2008-64-bit?forum=officesetupdeploylegacy">This
        approach is documented on MSDN</a>. Note that this breaks MS Window's sandbox model and imposes additional
        security threats to the machine that runs MS Office.
    </li>
</ol>

    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-local</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains the implementation of the <code>LocalConverter</code> which runs on the same
        physical machine.
    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-transformer-msoffice-word</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains the converter back-end for using MS Word. The backend should not be used directly but
        by an <code>IConverter</code> implementation such as <i>documents4j-local</i>. The MS Word converter is
        detected automatically when it is found on the class path.
    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-transformer-msoffice-excel</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains the converter back-end for using MS Excel. The backend should not be used directly but
        by an <code>IConverter</code> implementation such as <i>documents4j-local</i>. The MS Excel converter is
        detected automatically when it is found on the class path.
    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-client</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains the implementation of the <code>RemoteConverter</code> which communicates with a server
        that offers document conversion as a REST service.
    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-server</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains the implementation of the REST service that is required by for example
        the <i>documents4j-client</i> module. A server is created by a <code>ConversionServerBuilder</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-client-standalone</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains a standalone implementation of a <code>RemoteConverter</code> which can be run from the
        command line. You can download a shaded jar without any dependencies of this standalone client from
        <a href="https://bintray.com/raphw/maven/documents4j/_latestVersion">the Bintray page of documents4j</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>documents4j-server-standalone</dt>
    <dd>
        This module contains a standalone implementation of a conversion server which can be run from the
        command line. You can download a shaded jar without any dependencies of this standalone client from
        <a href="https://bintray.com/raphw/maven/documents4j/_latestVersion">the Bintray page of documents4j</a>.
        The standalone server defines dependencies on <i>documents4j-transformer-msoffice-word</i> and
        <i>documents4j-transformer-msoffice-excel</i> such that these converter back-ends must be
        deactivated explicitly when they are not required.
